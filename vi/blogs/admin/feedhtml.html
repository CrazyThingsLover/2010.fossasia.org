 <title>Opera Software Banks on Android’s Rise for Speedy Growth</title>
 <link>http://fossasia.org/vi/blogs/opera-software-banks-android%E2%80%99s-rise-speedy-growth</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/opera-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; width=&quot;567&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rapid influx of low-cost smartphones from China, Asia is slowly becoming a hub for many smartphone brands. Market research firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gfk.com/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GfK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last month that from March 2012 to March 2013, the number of smartphones sold in Southeast Asia grew by 61%, pushing the smartphone sales in the region to the US$ 11 billion mark. Experts believe that the rise was due to the arrival of affordable phones and tablets, and high-end operating systems. When it comes to OS, most Asians prefer Android over other OS platforms. Android is having a sensational ride in the Asian market and one company that benefits greatly from the operating system’s success is Opera. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opera Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; senior vice-president for Asia, Fabrizio Caruso, announced last Tuesday (June 18) that Android just became the second largest mobile OS platform among Opera Mini users in many countries in Southeast Asia and India, marking a 160% growth of users in the region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “From May 2012 to April 2013, we saw 148% Android Opera Mini user growth in India, 161% in Indonesia, 187% in Vietnam, and 214% in the Philippines,” Caruso said in an interview. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Web browsers play a critical role in a smartphone’s market success. Most smartphones, regardless of the continent, are now mainly used for browsing and other web-based features. People turn to their portable computers for emails, Google inquiries, games, and social media updates. Android phones are famous for their sleek interface and large developer community that create free applications. If they work on a reliable browser, there’s a bigger chance for that particular handset to be patronized by more consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A reliable web browser is a must for various smartphone activities, especially when playing online games. These games include MMORPGs, online casino games, betting games, and first-person shooter games. Among all these, browser games like slots, roulette, and poker require high-end browsers for seamless and unparalleled gaming experience. While MMORPGs can only be played by installing certain software, most casino games can be played right on the browser. For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.partycasino.com/games/slots.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;partycasino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed without the need to download the entire program. The only thing players need to do is get their smartphones connected to the web and start playing. But before doing that, they need to make sure that their smartphones have a reliable web browser like Opera Mini to maximize the potential of games such as this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Opera Mini should expect more as Android’s market growth shows no signs of slowing down. It is not just in Asia where the Linux-based operating system is dominant; it is also the most popular mobile OS in the United States and several European countries, as well. Apple’s iOS is far from second and Windows Phone is at third. Opera Software, as long as it runs on Android phones, sure has a promising future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
