# Unconference

FOSSASIA offers attendees "[Ignite Session][1]" or sessions for "Lightning Talks". The sessions are organized by [Preetam Rai][2] in an unconference-style well-known through [Barcamps][3] across the world. Each participant will have 5 minutes to present an idea, project or anything else he or she would like to share.

This will be the perfect opportunity to connect with the local open source community, and to get a feel for what some of the other projects are up to. Everyone who has something to share is encouraged to attend. Any conference-related talk is welcome.

This is how we roll:  
1\. Write a suggestion for a talk on the whiteboard at the beginning of the event  
2\. Attend the organizing session arranging talks  
3\. Be there at least 15 mins before your talk. If you have slides prepared, please hand them over to Preetam at the organizing session at the beginning.

#### Background

**Ignite Sessions**

Ignite is a style of presentation where participants are given five minutes to speak on a subject accompanied by 20 slides. Each slide is displayed for 15 seconds, and slides are automatically advanced. [Pecha Kucha][4] is a similar format that features 20 slides for 20 seconds each. The first Ignite was held in 2006 in [Seattle, Washington][5], and was the brainchild of Brady Forrest and [Bre Pettis][6]. It was sponsored by [O'Reilly Media][7] and [_MAKE][8]_ magazine. Since its inception, more than 50 Ignites have been started in cities around the world. O'Reilly has continued to support Ignite—one occurred during the 2009 [OSCON][9] held by the company—but each Ignite is independently organized on the local level. (Source [WP][1])

**Lightning Talks**

A Lightning Talk is a short presentation given at a conference  or similar forum. Unlike other presentations, lightning talks last only a few minutes and several will usually be delivered in a single period by different speakers. The length of talks are usually 5 minutes. (Source: [WP][10])
