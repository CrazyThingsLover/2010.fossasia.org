 **FOSSASIA 2010 Tracks**

**a) Lightweight solutions**

Lightweight solutions are currently a strong focus in all major IT markets be it  
* in the mobile device sector with solutions like Android, MeeGo, Chrome OS, Symbian, Bada, OpenWrt and embedded Debian  
* in the desktop market with lightweight trends with KDE, GNOME, LXDE and XFCE in Ubuntu and derivates like lubuntu, lightweights spins of Fedora, OpenSuse and others  
* in the web/browser market offering lighter and standard compliant solutions with HTML5  
* or in the server and cloud market with the trend to lighter NoSQL solutions which are more suitable for large data structures  
* and in the emerging Open Hardware sector

**b) Fostering the Asian community and Women in IT**

While most Open Source and Free Software projects are based in Western countries there is an increasing number of projects from Asia. One very successful project with a strong Asian community is LXDE, which is a community partner of FOSSASIA. Nevertheless, the number of Asian developers in Open Source is still limited even though the largest part of the human population lives in Asia. Women are also underrepresented in the IT community. The FOSSASIA team strongly encourages the participation of young women and achieved this goal with an astounding participation of women in 2009 – more than half of all attendees. The 2010 event will continue to support women to become contributors and learn about using Open Source and Free Software with offering additional track space for:

* Linux workshops for women  
* Design workshops with open tools like GIMP and Inkscape  
* A womens panel on how to collaborate across genders and cultures

**c) OpenOffice.org and Open Document Formats Key Focus**  


**d) Debian Mini-Debconf Asia (Debian Wiki page: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianVietnam/MiniDebConf2010 )**
